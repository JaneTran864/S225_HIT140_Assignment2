## Bat vs. Rat: The Forage Files
Uncovering the wild truth behind nocturnal food fights
### Background
A team of zoologists studied the foraging behaviour of the Egyptian Fruit Bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) in the presence of Black Rats (Rattus rattus). They set out to conduct a series of observations in a semi-natural, open bat colony over a 7-month period, where the interactions of both animals’ on a provisioned food platform were monitored using surveillance video cameras. The outcome of these observations was then collated into two datasets. The datasets are made accessible to you on Learnline and described in the sections below.

In this group project, you and your team members shall work together as ‘detectives’. You will match curiosity with your data science skills to support the zoologists in carrying out the following investigations:
### Investigations
**Investigation A**

Do bats perceive rats not just as competitors for food but also as potential predators? If rats are considered a predation risk by bats, scientists believe that this perception will translate into the bats’ higher level of avoidance behaviour or increased vigilance during foraging on the food platform.

**Investigation B**

Do the behaviours described above change following seasonal changes? It is known that in winter, alternative food sources are scarce and rat encounters are less frequent. In spring, food is more abundant and rat encounters are more common. To provide answers to both investigations, your team should decide the appropriate data science techniques to use for analysing the following datasets.

### Datasets
These are the two datasets that must be used in this project. They are downloadable from Learnline. 

**dataset1.csv**

The first dataset focuses on what happens each time a bat lands on a provisioned food platform when rats are present. Each row in this dataset is a unique, single bat landing on the food platform. It further describes the situational context and a bat’s observed behaviours following its landing. The zoologists manually detected each bat landings from the collected surveillance video footage, as previously described. Behavioural variables such as vigilance and foraging success of each landing were then manually annotated and quantified by watching the video recordings. Table 1 explains the meaning of variables in this dataset

**dataset2.csv**

The second dataset focuses on rats’ arrival events at the food platform. Each row in the dataset represents the outcome of a 30-minute continuous video surveillance recording of the same food platform as the one mentioned in dataset1.csv. The number of unique rat arrivals within each 30-minute interval was then manually counted from the recordings and aggregated. The dataset contains some other observations, such as the total number of bat landings and estimated food depletion in each period. Table 2 explains the meaning of variables in this dataset

### Project Objectives

**Objective 1 / Assessment 2**

Objective 1 must be addressed as part of Assessment 2 of this unit. Your team must perform descriptive and inferential data analyses in Python to carry out Investigation A only. You should use both datasets given above for your data analysis and present the results by recording a high-quality team presentation. For more information about the required submissions, please refer to the Assessment 2 page on Learnline.

**Objective 2 / Assessment 3**

Objective 2 must be addressed as part of Assessment 3 of this unit. Your team must revisit Investigation A, as well as carry out Investigation B using overall data science techniques you have learned in this unit. To complete this objective, your team must prepare and submit a high-quality group report. In addition to using both provided datasets, you may also consider procuring external data you deem relevant to your investigations. For more information about the required submissions, refer to the Assessment 3 page on Learnline.
